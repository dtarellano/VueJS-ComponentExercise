# vue-cli

> This is an exercise given to me by an Instructor. The Template and Styles were given to me.  This was to practice using Slots to pass props to Child Components.

> This exercise was also used to learn how to use the "Component" tag in VueJS to Dynamically change components onClick.

> Javascript was written by me to show my understand of these concepts.
